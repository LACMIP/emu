**Proper citation of musuem collections is critical to sustaining of these resources**. If you intend to include LACMIP specimens or localities in publication, please follow the protocols outlined below. Likewise, please share any publications that result from the use of these collections or their anscillary data with LACMIP staff. Questions and related inquiries can be directed to the collections manager: [lwalker@nhm.org](lwalker@nhm.org).

# Citing LACMIP specimens
## How to cite?
Specimens designated as types recognized by the [ICZN](https://www.iczn.org/outreach/faqs/#faq-4) should be referenced in-text using the catalog number (LACMIP locality#.lot#) and the type number (LACMIP Type #).

For example, "Fig. 1: **LACMIP 2533.234, LACMIP Type 3364**".
{: .notice--warning}

## Where can I find the catalog number?
During digitization, all LACMIP specimens receive a catalog number, which includes a locality and lot number. Each cataloged lot may contain one [or more](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012634986) specimens.

For example, LACMIP 2533.234 represents the 234th specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 2533.

* **For specimens that have been digitized**, these numbers can be found by querying the LACMIP datasets on GBIF and iDigBio, which currently include all fossil insects and Cretaceous marine invertebrates from California (more coming soon). [See below](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/citing/#citing-digitized-collections) for more information on citing digitized collections. 

* **For specimens that have not been digitized**, catalog numbers must be acquired from the collections manager.

## Where can I find the type number?
Specimens that receive LACMIP type numbers include:
- holotypes, syntypes, paratypes, lectotypes, neotypes, allotypes

Specimens that do **not** receive LACMIP type numbers include:
- hypotypes (figured or unfigured)

Hypotypes should reference the catalog number in-text, _and the type number if it is preexisting_; however, designation of any new type numbers for non name-bearing specimens is unnecessary.

In the 1970s-80s, catalogs of LACMIP type specimens were published by the museum. These catalogs, which include older type numbers, can be accessed [here](URL).

## What if I have numerous specimens to cite?
If citing both the catalog and type numbers in-text is overly cumbersome, the catalog number takes precedent in-text. **_However_**, both numbers should be included elsewhere in the publication. We suggest doing so in either a list or table. For example:

*Catalog No.* | *Type No.*
   --- | ---
   LACMIP 2533.234 | LACMIP Type 3364
   LACMIP 2533.235 | LACMIP Type 3365
   LACMIP 2533.236 | LACMIP Type 3366

# Citing LACMIP localities
LACMIP localities should be cited in text as "**LACMIP locality #**" or "**LACMIP loc. #**".

For example, "Fig. 1: **LACMIP loc. 2533**".

If you need to request new the creation of new localities, please download and complete this form and return it to the collections manager: [Locality Request Form](URL).

# Citing digitized collections
All LACMIP digital specimen data are formatted to the biodiversity data standards maintained by [TDWG](https://www.tdwg.org). Publishe data can be queried on GBIF and iDigBio.
