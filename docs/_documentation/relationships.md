Specimens that are physically stuck together but represent different taxa are cataloged separately (for example, when a bivalve and gastropod are preserved on the same rock, or when a trace fossil is cataloged on another specimen). Their respective catalog records must be associated using the *Relationships* tab in the Catalogue module.

## How to associate specimen records

* Once you have cataloged all specimens to be associated, open another instance of the Catalogue module.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships1.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}

* In this new instance, search for the records to be associated. Be sure you searched for the correct ones!
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships2.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships3.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}

* In the original instance of the Catalogue module, open one of the specimen records and navigate to the *Relationships* tab.
* Select all records to be associated in the second instance of the Catalogue module. Drag them into the *Related Records* fields on the first specimen record.
* Save this change and repeat steps 3-4 for all other specimen records that need to be associated. :repeat:
