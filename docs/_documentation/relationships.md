Specimens that are physically stuck together but represent different taxa must be cataloged separately (e.g., when a bivalve and gastropod are preserved on the same rock, or when a trace fossil is found on a body fossil). These records must be associated using the [*Relationships* tab](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/catalogue/) in the Catalogue module.

## Workflow

*1.* After cataloging all specimens to be associated, open a second instance of the Catalogue module from within the _Related Records_ field. 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships1.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}

*2.* In the new instance of the Catalogue module, search for all records to be associated.

*3.* In the original instance of the Catalogue module, open one of the specimen records and navigate to the *Relationships* tab.

*4.* Select all records to be associated in the second instance of the Catalogue module. Drag them into the *Related Records* table iin the first instance of the Catalogue module. If you are trying to associate more than three records, enlarge the active window so more row are visible in the _Related Records_ table.

*5.* **Circular relationships should be avoided.** Therefore, delete the row in the _Related Records_ table that references the specimen record you are actively working on (right-click on the row and select "Delete".)

*6.* Save this change and :repeat:repeat steps 3-5:repeat: for all other specimen records that need to be associated.
