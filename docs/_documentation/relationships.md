Specimens that are physically stuck together but represent different taxa are cataloged separately (for example, when a bivalve and gastropod are preserved on the same rock). Their respective catalog records must be associated using the *Relationships* tab in the Catalogue module.

**Suggested workflow for associating specimen records:**

* Open another instance of the Catalogue module.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships1.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}

* In this new instance, search for the specimen records to be associated. Be sure you searched for the correct records. :warning:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships2.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships3.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}

* In the original instance of the Catalogue module, open the first specimen record to be associated and navigate to the *Relationships* tab.
* Select the records to be associated in the second instance of the Catalogue module. Drag them into the *Related Records* fields on the first specimen record.
* Save this change and repeat steps 3-4 for all other specimen records that need to be associated. :repeat:
