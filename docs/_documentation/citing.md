**Proper citation of museum collections is critical to sustaining these resources**. If you intend to include LACMIP specimens or localities in publication, please follow the protocols outlined below. Likewise, please share any publications that result from the use of these collections or their anscillary data with LACMIP staff. 

Questions and related inquiries can be directed to the collections manager: [lwalker@nhm.org](lwalker@nhm.org).

# Citing LACMIP specimens
## How to cite?
Specimens designated as types recognized by the [ICZN](https://www.iczn.org/outreach/faqs/#faq-4) should be referenced in-text using the **catalog number** and the **type number**.

Example: "**LACMIP 2533.234, LACMIP Type 3364**"
{: .notice--warning}

## Where can I find the catalog number?
All digitized LACMIP specimens have received a catalog number, which includes a locality and lot number (i.e., LACMIP loc#.lot#). In turn, each cataloged lot may contain one or more individual specimens. If you intend to illustrate a specimen from a lot with multiple individuals, it is LACMIP's preference that a new catalog number be generated for this individual specimen.

Example 1: [LACMIP 10088.8](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012637492) represents the 8th specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 10088. This specimen lot contains one specimen.
{: .notice--warning}

Example 2: [LACMIP 23192.1](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012634986) represents the 1st specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 23192. This specimen lot contains multiple specimens. 
{: .notice--warning}

**For specimens that have been digitized**, catalog numbers can be found by querying the LACMIP datasets on GBIF and iDigBio, which currently include all fossil insects and Cretaceous marine invertebrates from California (more coming soon).

[See below](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/citing/#citing-digitized-collections) for more information on how to cite digitized collections. 

**For specimens that have not been digitized**, catalog numbers must be acquired from the collections manager.

## Where can I find the type number?
**Specimens that receive LACMIP type numbers include:**
- holotypes, syntypes, paratypes, lectotypes, neotypes, allotypes

**Specimens with type numbers for internal use only include:**
- hypotypes (figured or unfigured)

If a specimen has a type number, this number must be referenced in-text, even for hypotypes that were historically designated type numbers.

## What if I have numerous specimens to cite?
If citing both the catalog and type numbers in-text becomes overly cumbersome, the catalog number takes precedent in-text. **_However_**, both numbers should be included elsewhere in the publication. We suggest doing so in either list or table format. For example:

*Catalog No.* | *Type No.*
   --- | ---
   LACMIP 2533.234 | LACMIP Type 3364
   LACMIP 2533.235 | LACMIP Type 3365
   LACMIP 2533.236 | LACMIP Type 3366
   {: .notice--warning}

# Citing LACMIP localities
LACMIP localities should be cited in text as "**LACMIP locality #**" or "**LACMIP loc. #**".

Example: "**LACMIP loc. 2533**" or "**LACMIP locality 2533**".
{: .notice--warning}

If you need to request new the creation of new localities, contact the collections manager.

# Citing digitized collections
If your research has benefitted from LACMIP's digitized collections data in any way, please include the suggested citation for our dataset on GBIF in your reference list.

Example: Hendy A, Walker L, Mertz W (2020). LACM Invertebrate Paleontology. Version 1.7. Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Occurrence dataset [https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) accessed via GBIF.org on 2020-05-19.
