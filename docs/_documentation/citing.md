**Proper citation of museum collections is critical to sustaining these resources**. If you intend to include LACMIP specimens or localities in publication, please follow the guidelines below. Likewise, in exchange for the use of LACMIP collections data in your research, we request that any resulting publications be shared with LACMIP staff.

Questions and related inquiries should be directed to the collections manager: [lwalker@nhm.org](lwalker@nhm.org).

# Citing LACMIP specimens
## How to cite?
Type and figured specimens should be referenced in-text using the **catalog number** and the **type number**.

Example: "**LACMIP 2533.234, LACMIP Type 3364**"
{: .notice--warning}

## What if I have numerous specimens to cite?
If citing both the catalog and type numbers in-text becomes overly cumbersome, the catalog number takes precedent in-text. **_However_**, both numbers should still be included elsewhere in the publication. We suggest doing so in either list or table format.

*Catalog No.* | *Type No.*
   --- | ---
   LACMIP 2533.234 | LACMIP Type 3364
   LACMIP 2533.235 | LACMIP Type 3365
   LACMIP 2533.236 | LACMIP Type 3366
   {: .notice--warning}

## Where can I find these numbers?
**All LACMIP specimens receive catalog numbers during digitization.** Each catalog number includes a locality number _and_ lot number (i.e., LACMIP loc#.lot#), and, in turn, each lot may contain one or more individual specimens. If you intend to illustrate a specimen from a lot with multiple individuals, it is LACMIP's preference that a new catalog number be generated for each individual specimen. For example:

- [LACMIP 10088.8](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012637492) represents the 8th specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 10088. This lot contains one specimen.
- [LACMIP 23192.1](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012634986) represents the 1st specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 23192. This lot contains multiple specimens.

The LACMIP collections began issuing **type numbers** in the 1960s. However, in the 1980s, several large donations were assimilated into the LACMIP collections, meaning some "UCLA" and "CIT" numbers (among others) cited in the literature now have new, equivalent LACMIP numbers.

**Specimens that receive type numbers include:**
- holotypes, syntypes, paratypes, lectotypes, neotypes, allotypes, figured hypotypes

**Specimens with type numbers for internal use only:**
- unfigured hypotypes

If a specimen has a type number, it must be referenced in-text with the catalog number. **Note that LACMIP is no longer minting new type numbers for unfigured hypotypes**.

A large number of LACMIP's type specimens were published in the NHMLA's _Contributions in Science_ series (1957-2017), which is now available from the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/122696#/summary).

As such, they were originally cited using different institutional numbers. These numbers now have equivalent LACMIP catalog and type numbers. As one example, [LACMIP 10079.7](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012641180) is illustrated in pink above." %}

**For specimens that have been digitized**, catalog numbers and type numbers can be found by querying the LACMIP datasets on GBIF and iDigBio, which currently include fossil insects and Cretaceous marine invertebrates from California. This information is contained in the _dwc:catalogueNumber_ and _dwc:otherCatalogueNumbers_ fields on occurrence records and in data downloads.

See below for more information on [how to cite digitized collections](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/citing/#citing-digitized-collections). 

**For specimens that have not been digitized**, new numbers may need to be created. The collections manager can verify this information for you.

# Citing LACMIP localities
LACMIP localities should be cited in text as "**LACMIP locality #**" or "**LACMIP loc. #**".

Example: "**LACMIP loc. 2533**" or "**LACMIP locality 2533**".
{: .notice--warning}

If you need new locality numbers, complete the [LACMIP Locality Request Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1xc2jFS-fva_YW_9lPM89yGpv7XCacIA1H0SAAgA8w/edit?usp=sharing) and submit it to the collections manager with any relevant permitting documentation.

# Citing digitized collections
**Digitizing collections requires significant resources that can only be sustained with evidence of use through proper attribution.** If your research has benefitted from LACMIP's digitized collections data in any way, _**please**_ include the suggested citation for [our GBIF dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) or [the archived resource](http://ipt.idigbio.org/resource?r=lacm-ip) in your reference list.

Example: Hendy A, Walker L, Mertz W (2020). LACM Invertebrate Paleontology. Version 1.7. Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Occurrence dataset [https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) accessed via GBIF.org on 2020-05-19.
