**Proper citation of museum collections is critical to sustaining these resources**. If you intend to include LACMIP specimens or localities in publication, please follow the guidelines below. Likewise, in exchange for the use of LACMIP collections data in your research, we request that any resulting publications be shared with LACMIP staff.

Questions and related inquiries should be directed to the collections manager: [lwalker@nhm.org](lwalker@nhm.org).

# Citing LACMIP specimens
## How to cite?
Type and figured specimens should be referenced in-text using the **catalog number** and the **type number**.

Example: "**LACMIP 2533.234, LACMIP Type 3364**"
{: .notice--warning}

## Where can I find the catalog number?
LACMIP specimens receive catalog numbers during digitization, which includes a locality number _and_ lot number (i.e., LACMIP loc#.lot#). In turn, each cataloged lot may contain one or more individual specimens. If you intend to illustrate a specimen from a lot with multiple individuals, it is LACMIP's preference that a new catalog number be generated for this individual specimen.

Example 1: [LACMIP 10088.8](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012637492) represents the 8th specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 10088. This specimen lot contains one specimen.

Example 2: [LACMIP 23192.1](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012634986) represents the 1st specimen lot cataloged from LACMIP locality 23192. This specimen lot contains multiple specimens.

**For specimens that have been digitized**, catalog numbers can be found by querying the LACMIP datasets on GBIF and iDigBio, which currently include all fossil insects and Cretaceous marine invertebrates from California (more coming soon).

See below for more information on [how to cite digitized collections](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/citing/#citing-digitized-collections). 

**For specimens that have not been digitized**, new catalog numbers must be acquired from the collections manager.

## Where can I find the type number?
**Specimens that receive type numbers include:**
- holotypes, syntypes, paratypes, lectotypes, neotypes, allotypes, figured hypotypes

**Specimens with type numbers for internal use only:**
- unfigured hypotypes

If a specimen has a historically designated LACMIP type number, it must be referenced in-text. However, note that LACMIP is no longer minting new type numbers for unfigured hypotypes.

The LACMIP collections began issuing type numbers for specimens used in publication in the late 1960s. These numbers have been cited in publications since then, but may be mistaken for LACMIP locality numbers (i.e., interpret with caution!). 

For type specimens that have been digitized, these numbers can be found the on their corresponding occurrence records:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/citing_typenumber.png" alt="screenshot of a type number on GBIF" caption="Screenshot illustrating where to locate type numbers." %}

## What if I have numerous specimens to cite?
If citing both the catalog and type numbers in-text becomes overly cumbersome, the catalog number takes precedent in-text. **_However_**, both numbers should still be included elsewhere in the publication. We suggest doing so in either list or table format.

*Catalog No.* | *Type No.*
   --- | ---
   LACMIP 2533.234 | LACMIP Type 3364
   LACMIP 2533.235 | LACMIP Type 3365
   LACMIP 2533.236 | LACMIP Type 3366
   {: .notice--warning}

# Citing LACMIP localities
LACMIP localities should be cited in text as "**LACMIP locality #**" or "**LACMIP loc. #**".

Example: "**LACMIP loc. 2533**" or "**LACMIP locality 2533**".
{: .notice--warning}

If you need to request the creation of new locality numbers, contact the collections manager for a copy of the LACMIP Locality Request Form.

# Citing digitized collections
If your research has benefitted from LACMIP's digitized collections data in any way, _**please**_ include the suggested citation for [our GBIF dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) in your reference list. Collections digitization requires significant resources that can only be sustained with evidence of use through proper attribution.

Example: Hendy A, Walker L, Mertz W (2020). LACM Invertebrate Paleontology. Version 1.7. Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Occurrence dataset [https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) accessed via GBIF.org on 2020-05-19.
