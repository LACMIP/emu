**Proper citation of museum collections is critical to sustaining these resources and the reproducibility of your research.** If you intend to include LACMIP specimens or localities in publication, please follow the guidelines below. Likewise, in exchange for the use of LACMIP collections data in your research, we request that any resulting publications be shared with LACMIP staff.

Questions and related inquiries should be directed to the collections manager: [lwalker@nhm.org](lwalker@nhm.org).

# Citing LACMIP specimens
## How to cite?
Type and figured specimens should be referenced in-text using the **catalog number** and the **type number**.

Example: "**LACMIP 2533.234, LACMIP Type 3364**"
{: .notice--warning}

## Catalog vs. Type Numbers
All LACMIP specimens receive catalog numbers during digitization. Each catalog number includes a locality number _and_ lot number (i.e., LACMIP loc#.lot#), and each lot may contain one or more individual specimens. If you intend to figure/illustrate a specimen from a lot with multiple individuals, it is LACMIP's preference that a new catalog number be generated for each individual specimen.

**Specimens that may receive new type numbers include:**
- holotypes, syntypes, paratypes, lectotypes, neotypes, allotypes

**Specimens that do not receive type numbers include:**
- figured and unfigured hypotypes, mentioned/referred specimens

However, if a specimen has a _preexisting_ type number (even hypotypes), it must be referenced in-text alongside the catalog number.

**For specimens that have been digitized since 2015**, catalog and type numbers can be found by querying the LACMIP datasets on GBIF and iDigBio, which currently include records for Cretaceous through Cenozoic marine invertebrates from California, as well as all insects from the Statz, Pierce, and Rancho La Brea insect type collections. These datasets will be maintained and expanded upon into the foreseeable future:
- [LACMIP's GBIF dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen)
- [LACMIP's iDigBio recordset](https://www.idigbio.org/portal/recordsets/5082e6c8-8f5b-4bf6-a930-e3e6de7bf6fb)

**For specimens that are not yet digitized and online**, new catalog and or type numbers may need to be created. Please contact the collections manager to verify whether this is necessary.

Existing type numbers will be listed under _Other catalogue numbers_, e.g. [LACMIP 10079.7](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012641180)." %}

## What if I have numerous specimens to cite?
If citing both the catalog and type numbers in-text becomes overly cumbersome, the catalog number takes precedent in-text. However, both numbers should still be included elsewhere in the publication. We suggest doing so in either list or table format.

*Catalog No.* | *Type No.*

   LACMIP 2533.234 | LACMIP Type 3364
   LACMIP 2533.235 | LACMIP Type 3365

## Brief history of these numbers

Comprehensive inventories of the LACMIP type collection were first published by [Wilson and Bing (1970)](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/52108823) and [Sphon (1973)](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/52110575). Supplements to these catalogs, including specimens transferred to LACMIP from UCLA, were later published by [Wilson (1986)](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21194970), [Saul (1991)](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1086135842), and [Saul (1993)](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28818677). Subsequently, catalog numbers were assigned to all specimen lots, which now serve as the primary identifiers for LACMIP's specimens. **Now that LACMIP's collections are becoming available online, citing the catalog number is necessary to enable full digital connectivity between these specimens and the published literature.**

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/citing_example.png" alt="example of LACMIP type specimens figured in publication" caption="Large portions of the LACMIP collections once belonged to local universities. As such, they were originally cited using different institutional numbers. These numbers now have equivalent LACMIP catalog and type numbers. Two examples, [LACMIP 10079.7](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012641180) and [LACMIP 10100.11](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2012653749), are illustrated in pink and blue.

# Citing LACMIP localities
LACMIP localities should be cited in text as "**LACMIP locality #**" or "**LACMIP loc. #**". This format eliminates potential confusion between LACMIP locality and type numbers.

Example: "**LACMIP loc. 2533**" or "**LACMIP locality 2533**".

If you would like to request new LACMIP locality numbers, download and complete the [LACMIP Locality Request Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1xc2jFS-fva_YW_9lPM89yGpv7XCacIA1H0SAAgA8w/edit?usp=sharing) and submit it to the collections manager, along with any relevant documentation, including collecting permits. (Open [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1xc2jFS-fva_YW_9lPM89yGpv7XCacIA1H0SAAgA8w/edit?usp=sharing) > _File_ > _Download_). Keep in mind that each LACMIP locality is intended to represent a unique sampling event at the finest geographic and stratigraphic resolution possible; for example, if a field party collects from the same bed over two days, two or more locality numbers may apply.

# Citing the collections as an entity
The LACMIP collections can also be cited as a whole by including the suggested citation for [our GBIF dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) in your reference list. Please do so if your research has benefitted from our collections in any way:

Example: Hendy A, Walker L, Mertz W (2020). LACM Invertebrate Paleontology. Version 1.8. Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Occurrence dataset [https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen](https://doi.org/10.15468/6nxzen) accessed via GBIF.org on 2020-07-21.

Additionally, or alternatively, a customized and citable data download may be generated to reference digitized LACMIP specimens in publications. Contact the collections manager if you would like assistance with creating one.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/citing_datadownload.png" alt="image of a custom data download on GBIF.org" caption="[Example](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.ykhkrs) of a customized data download with a citable DOI." %}
