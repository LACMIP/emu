Every time an EMu user inserts or modifies a record, EMu documents this change; the Audit Trails module is where this documentation lives. 

## Search Audit Trails via the Audit tab

Audit trails can be confusing, but are helpful for determining when a change (or series of changes) were made in EMu. You can see a history of edits by using the *Audit* tab in the Catalog or Audit modules.  Audit trails can be very long, and therefore certain extensive searches can take awhile.

Example:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_auditsearch.png" alt="searching the Catalogue module's Audit tab" caption="Searching the *Audit* tab in the Catalogue module." %}

Result: 17 matches

Open any one of the records and look at the Audit tab.  
 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_audit.png" alt="searching the Catalogue module's Audit tab" caption="Searching the *Audit* tab in the Catalogue module." %}

In this example, "dlucas" updated the record at 2:14pm and "dmarkbrieiter" updated it again at 3:30pm.

Select the "dlucas" row and click the blue arrow at right to see the details in the Audit Trails module. (If you do not select a row, the blue arrow will open all three records.)

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/audittrails_summary.png" alt="searching the Catalogue module's Audit tab" caption="Results displayed in the Audit Trails module." %}

 Therefore, in this instance, "dlucas" changed *Type Status* from "figured" to "hypotype", and *Project* from "EPICC" to "IMLS".

Your color scheme may be different.  In this example, pink indicates new data, and blue replaced data. The color scheme can be customized in Tools > Options... > Colours.
