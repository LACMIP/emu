Specimens that are phyiscally stuck together but represent two different taxa must be cataloged separately. For example, when a bivalve and gastropod occur on the same rock. These records must be associated using the *Relationships* tab in the Catalogue module.

Suggested workflow for associating multiple specimen records in the Catalogue module:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships1.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}
1. Open another instance of the Catalogue module.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships2.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships3.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}
2. In this new instance, search for the specimen records to be associated. Be sure you searched for the correct records.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/catalogue_relationships4.png" alt="screenshot of the Relationships tab in the catalogue module" %}
3. In the original instance of the Catalogue module, open the first specimen record to be associated and navigate to the *Relationships* tab.

4. Select the records to be associated in the second instance of the Catalogue module. Drag them into the *Related Records* fields on the first specimen record.

5. Save thsi change and repeat steps 3-4 for all other specimen records that need to be associated.
