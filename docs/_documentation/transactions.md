The Transactions Module is the primary record for information about transactions such as loans. This module is maintained by the Museum registrar and read-only to LACMIP.

However, **loans should still be tracked by LACMIP in the Catalogue Module** by 1) updating the Disposition (_Disp._) of each affected record and 2) making a comment in _Lot Remarks_, as shown below. Comments in reference to loans should precede all other text in _Lot Remarks_ and should follow this format: 
 
**On loan to Firstname Lastname, Institutional Affiliation (YYYY-MM-DD) (email[at]email).**
