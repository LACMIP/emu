EMu offers a variety of methods to search for records. Please see the [Search Modes]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/modes/) documentation for an overview. Axiell also has several good resources for learning more about searching in EMu:
- information on [basic search](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/How%20to%20search.htm)
- additional information on [advanced searching](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Search%20-%20section.htm)
- [cheatsheet](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Resources/Downloads/Unicode/EMu_Unicode_Cheatsheet_IE_20170602.pdf) for search terms

## List of values

You can copy-paste a list of values into EMu using the **"Paste (Insert)"** command. To access this command, copy a list either from a spreadsheet or text file (each value needs to be on a new line), then right-click in the field for which you want to paste.

If the command is grayed out, as it is here, try left-clicking in any other field and then **right**-clicking in the field you wish to paste into." %}

On a Mac youâ€™ll need to click with two fingers on your trackpad to right-click.

## Nested tables

The design of EMu involves nested tables, i.e. a table of values that exists within a record, which is itself a row in a table. For instance, the Catalogue record for LACMIP 24000.1 is represented in the EMu database as a row in the Catalogue Module table, and within this row there is another set of rows holding the data in the *Alternative Numbers* fields.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/search_nestedtable.png" alt="screenshot of nested table" caption="EMu's Catalogue module stores *Alternative Numbers* in a nested table with fields for *Inst. Code* and *Inst. Number*." %}

**Nested tables can make searching in EMu  difficult.** Consider a situation where you want to be able to bring up all the site records where there are more than one set of georeferencing coordinates. In other words, you want to search by the number of rows within a nested table. This kind of search requires a report, as does any search that requires pairing values within a nested table, e.g. site records where one of the Lat/Long coordinates has both *Determined By*="Dalton, Trevor" and *Preferred*="No".

## Specimen identifications

Searching for specimens by their taxonomic identification will also bring up records that are identified with related names, i.e. synonyms.

## Records with multimedia

The easiest way to find all records (e.g. in the Catalogue module) that have multimedia attached is to search for `\+` in the *Title* field of the *Multimedia* tab.

## Saved searches

You may want to save commonly-used search criteria as a Group. To learn more about groups, see documentation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/groups/).
