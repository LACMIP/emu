The Projects module is used to track and report statistics for collections-related research and outreach requests. Only members of the Invertebrate Paleontology permissions group can add and edit information in this module.

Before creating new records, new users of the Projects module should view previously created records in this module for examples. This can be done by searching for all previous entires in this module and selecting the "IP Requests" list view (_View > List Settings > Choose List > IP Requests_). Sort the results by "Project Sub-Type".

It is recommended that new entries in the Projects module are created using the [ditto function](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/The%20Ditto%20utility.htm?Highlight=ditto) to use existing records as templates to maintain consistency in data entry in this module.

## Project 1 tab

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/projects_project1.png" alt="screenshot of the Project 1 tab in the Projects module" caption="Screenshot of the *Projects 1* tab of the Projects module. Users in the *Invertebrate Paleontology* permission group can enter and edit data in this module." %}

Information must be entered in two fields on the *Projects 1* tab:

Sub-Type
: A controlled vocabulary to note what type of request or event is being recorded. The controlled vocabulary includes:
    - "Exhibit"
    - "Field Trip"
    - "Museum Event"
    - "Presentation"
    - "Public Inquiry"
    - "Request (Catalog Numbers)"
    - "Request (Images)"
    - "Request (Loans)"
    - "Request (Locality Numbers)"
    - "Research Visit"
    - "Tour (Carson)"
    - "Tour (NHM)"
    - "Other"
    
Description
: Begin describing the event or request using an action, e.g. "Sent 3D scans of 15 ammonoids to..." Descriptions should be succinct but mention any relevant taxa, geologic context, or collections involved in or affected by the request/event, e.g., "...the Stoyanow Collection", and especially any important information not captured in other fields in the Projects module. When _Sub-Type_="Request (Loans)", locality numbers should be included here. View previously entered Project module records for examples.


## Project 2 tab

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/projects_project2.png" alt="screenshot of the Project 2 tab in the Projects module" caption="Screenshot of the *Project 2* tab of the Projects module." %}

Information must be entered in one field on the *Project 2* tab:

Organisers
: Attach the appropriate Parties records for whomever fullfilled the request or participated in the event.

Funding Associations
: Attach the appropriate Parties records for any funding sources related to the request or event whenver applicable.

Intended Audience
: For outreach-related requests and events, select the appropriate value from the controlled vocabulary:
    - "Advancement/Donors"
    - "Educators"
    - "General public"
    - "Students"
    - "Other"
    - "N/A" (use for research-related requests and events)
    

## Dates tab

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/projects_dates.png" alt="screenshot of the Dates tab in the Projects module" caption="Screenshot of the *Dates* tab of the Projects module." %}

Information must be entered in one field on the *Dates* tab:

Commencement Date
: Select the date that the event occurred or the request was fulfilled.


## Objects tab

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/projects_objects.png" alt="screenshot of the Objects tab in the Projects module" caption="Screenshot of the *Objects* tab of the Projects module." %}

Any cataloged specimen lots associated with the event or request should be attached to the _Objects Associated With Project_ table on the _Objects_ tab. Do so by opening the Catalogue module from the _Object_ field and searching for the relevant catalogue records. Sort the results by catalog number. Select all records in the Catalogue module and drag them into the _Objects Associated With Project_ table.

Only attach objects to records in the Projects module for specimens that researchers and visitors came in direct contact with, or objects that you had to physically handle to fullfill a request. (I.e., do not attach all existing catalogue records for general tours of type room or entire LACMIP collection!)
