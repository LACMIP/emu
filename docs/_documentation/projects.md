The Projects module is used to track and report statistics for collections-related research and outreach requests. Only members of the Invertebrate Paleontology permissions group can add and edit information in this module.

When using this module for the first time, it is recommended to view all records in this module by searching for all previous entires in this module and selecting the "IP Requests" list view to preview (_View > List Settings > Choose List > IP Requests_). Sort the results by "Project Sub-Type".

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/projects_overview" alt="Search results in the Projects module." caption="Search results in the Projects module." %}


## Project 1 tab

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/projects_project1.png" alt="screenshot of the Project 1 tab in the Projects module" caption="Screenshot of the *Projects 1* tab of the Projects module. Users in the *Invertebrate Paleontology* permission group can enter and edit data in this module." %}

Data need to be entered in two fields on the *Projects 1* tab:

Sub-Type
: A controlled vocabulary to note what type of request or event is being recorded. The controlled vocabulary includes:
    - "Exhibit"
    - "Field Trip"
    - "Museum Event"
    - "Presentation"
    - "Public Inquiry"
    - "Request (Catalog Numbers)"
    - "Request (Images)"
    - "Request (Loans)"
    - "Request (Locality Numbers)"
    - "Research Visit"
    - "Tour (Carson)"
    - "Tour (NHM)"
    - "Other"
    
Description
: Begin describing the event or request using a descriptive action, e.g. "Prepared loan for Richard Squires..." or "Sent images of 30 ammonoids to..." Descriptions should be succinct and mention any relevant taxa, geologic context, or collections involved in or affected by the request/event, e.g., "...the Stoyanow Collection". Include any important information not captured in other fields in the Projects module here.
