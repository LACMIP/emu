Are you planning to donate fossils to the LACMIP collections? This page outlines the process so you can know what to expect.

# Donation Workflow
## Pre-Donation
The first step in the donation process is to send a clear description of the material you plan to donate:
- Complete the [Pre-donation Form](https://forms.gle/DgJF5DUaooFsdyof6). Please do not submit the form until you have all of the information requested.
- If you are donating a large collection, be aware that a more comprehensive **inventory** may be requested _prior_ to the collection arriving at the museum. The purpose of the pre-donation form and (when applicable) inventory is to ensure LACMIP is the most appropriate repository for your specimens _prior_ to their arrival at the museum.
- Collections staff may request that you provide detailed **locality information** _prior_ to the collection arriving at the museum. We recommend downloading a copy of our [Locality Request Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1xc2jFS-fva_YW_9lPM89yGpv7XCacIA1H0SAAgA8w/edit?usp=sharing) to do so.

**Be prepared to provide evidence that all specimens to be donated were legally collected, and, in the case of international acquisitions, accompanied by import/export documentation from the country/ies of origin**. This stipulation applies to fossils that were personally collected or purchased. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, copies of collecting permits, letters of permission to collect, and/or import/export documentation. While it is our aim to accomodate new collections whenever possible, be aware that the museum reserves the right to refuse collections that are not well documented.

## Transportation
Once the museum decides that it can most likely accomodate donation, the specimens must be transported to the collections.
- Personal delivery ("hand carry") is preferred as this method minimizes the risk of damage or loss of the specimens during transit.
- If hand carry is not an option, shipping may be acceptable in some cases. Shipping is undertaken at the owner's risk and the use of couriers (FedEx, UPS, DHL) and tracking numbers is highly encouraged. _Please do not ship any specimens via the postal service._

## Receipt
Once the specimens are acquired by the museum, a receipt will be issued to you indicating the fossils were received. The document will be emailed to you by our registrar to be electronically DocuSigned.

## Accession
"Accessioning" refers to the process by which a specimen becomes the legal property of the museum.
