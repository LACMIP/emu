Updates to EMu are made by either the Museum's database manager or by Axiell, depending on what needs to be changed. If you have a request, contact the Museum's database manager (Bill Mertz) and he will let you know whether it is possible and, if so, when. Check out the [LACMIP Github issues](https://github.com/LACMIP/emu/issues) as well. For updates done by Axiell, the process is not quick and it may be months between request and implementation.

New versions of the EMu software are produced by Axiell and implemented by demand of the institution. NHMLA currently uses EMu 5.1. The [latest version of EMu (6.0)](https://alm.axiell.com/emu-6-0-user-interface-upgrade/) was released mid-2018 and is primarily an update to the user interface. The version after EMu 6.0 will be, according to Axiell, more of an upgrade to the underlying database architecture of the software.
