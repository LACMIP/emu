# Catalogue module
## How to "delete" at catalog record & dealing with double cataloged lots
Deleting catalog records should be avoided, especially if that record has already made its way to one of LACMIP's published online datasets. If you find a specimen lot that should be "deleted" (or, more accurately, disregarded) and the accidentaly catalog number should not be recycled, on the "bad" record, make the following changes:
| Tab | Field | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Invert. Paleo. | _Disposition_ | "discarded" |
| Invert. Paleo. | _Lot Remarks_ | Begin the lot remarks with, "Disregard this catalog record." You can add more detail, if needed, including the correct catalog number after this statement. |
| Security | _Publish on Internet_ | "no" |

ðŸ›‘ **Only staff** should delete or annotate catalog records to be discarded!
