The Taxonomy module is the primary record for information about taxonomic concepts, both accepted and unaccepted. Please see [Axiell's documentation](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/EMu/Taxonomy%20module.htm) for generic information about this module.

## Taxonomic hierarchy

*[need content]* Notes: Kingdom is in the structure of the data but not visible; e.g. Plantae exists and can be found by searching for rank=kingdom. When you update information that affects lower level taxonomy (e.g. changing the order that a family is in) you will need to restart EMu to see the changes take affect.

## Accepted vs. unaccepted names

*[need content]* Notes: Currently Accepted can have values Yes (= names that exist in literature or in collection and that we want printed on a label), No (= old names that have a synonym; SOMETIMES two records for one old name will exist when that old name is linked to two current names, see Fulguraria gabbi for an example), or Unknown (= only use for names that will never be printed; use sparingly; as a flag to come back to. Cannot attach a valid name.)
