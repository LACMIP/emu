# Pyrite Decay Mitigation

## A few tips for identifying pyrite decay:** 
    - Signs of decay include efflorescent powder, expansion cracks, and acid burns on either the label or the tray that the specimen is housed in.
    - Efflorescence can be many different colors. Most of the efflorescence we saw in the Jurassic specimens was either gray or yellow.
    - Some material will only display one of the signs and the effects may only be visible on a small section of the specimen.
    - Be sure to look at both sides of each fossil to ensure that you do not miss any.

## Inventorying
- Begin looking through whichever area of the collections you are planning on pulling pyritized specimens from. We pulled all of the pyritized specimens from the Jurassic. Examine each specimen in the cabinet for signs of pyrite decay.
- Pull any pyritized material and complete "Specimen Removed" tags for each one.
- Each fossil should also be added to a specialized Pyrite Decay inventory spreadsheet. The spreadsheet should have columns in which you should record each of the following:

   *Column* | *Information*
   --- | ---
   **Geologic Time Period** | Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, etc. 
   **Cabinet Number** | The number of the cabinet that the pyritized specimen was removed from. If the specimen was displaced, check the original LACMIP inventory for that time period and attempt to cross reference a cabinet and drawer number from that. If unable to find the original cabinet or drawer number, it is okay to then put "unknown." 
   **Drawer Number**| The number of the drawer that the pyritized specimen was removed from. Remember for most cabinets in the collection drawers are counted going downwards, so drawers 1-6 are on the lefthand side and drawers 7-12 are on the righthand side. If the original location of the specimen is unknown, follow the same instructions as above. 
   **LACMIP Loc** | The LACMIP locality number as represented on the specimen's label or on white paint on the surface of the specimen. If there is no LACMIP locality available, record any other institution's numbers that are visible. 
   **Pyrite Scale** | Using your own judgement, quantify the severity of the pyrite decay using the qualitative assessment graphic below. Note that any specimens classified as a 3 are no longer viable research specimens and should be deaccessioned. Still include these specimens in your spreadsheet.
  **Taxonomy** | Taxonomic name of the specimen. If unavaible, add in the highest known classification of the specimen. Ex. "Ammonoidea" if the specimen is an ammonoid without proper identification. 
  **Lot Count** | How many specimens are in that specific lot.
  **Visual Notes** | Description of the specimen and pyrite decay. Examples: Is efflorescent present and if so, what color is it? Are there expansion cracks and if so, how severe? Is any part of the specimen crumbling?
  **Tray Notes** | Description of the tray if it is affected by the pyritization. Is there any staining on the tray? Is the tray ripping or broken due to the decay? If there are no visible effects on the tray, leave this cell blank.
  **Label Notes** | Description of the label if it is affected by the pyritization. Is there any staining or burn marks on the label? If there are no visible affects on the tray leave this cell blank.
  **Tray Type** | Was the tray that the specimen was housed in "wood" or "metal"
  **Notes** | Use this cell to record any other comments on the specimen if necessary. For example, record if there are no labels or locality information associated with the specimen or if the specimen is so severely damaged that it is impossible to obtain any of the other information.

## Digitizing the Specimens 

  - **Catalog** the specimens in EMu if they are not already cataloged. Follow the Cataloging Workflow. Print specimen tags.
    - The project that the specimens belong to is **PYR.**
    - Make sure to differentiate any specimen numbers from a previous institution.
    - **Relocate** the specimens in EMu to their original cabinet and drawer location, using the information you recorded in your Pyrite Inventory spreadsheet. Then, **relocate again** to the First Aid Cabinet.
  - **Image** the specimens according to the instructions in the Imaging Workflow including the barcoding reading script.
      - All pictures should be taken with the specimen's cataloged barcodes. In some severe cases, the specimen cannot be cataloged and will not be imaged with a barcode.
      - First, get an untouched view of the specimen/s and label/s in their original tray without moving anything.
      - Then, get an image with the specimen/s and label/s removed from the tray. Keep the orientations of the specimens the same throughout all the images. If necessary, take pictures of both sides of the material to ensure that all institution numbers and instances of pyritization are properly recorded.
