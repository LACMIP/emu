Scanning documentation using the Epson ScanSmart provides a means to digitize important and fragile handwritten/type written collections records with optical character recognition. The IP department has used this workflow to digitize taxa cards and historic UCLA catalog record books. 
## Workflow overview for UCLA Catalog Records 
These catalog records contain the specimen and locality documentation for the UCLA invertebrate paleontology collection which was transferred to the LACMIP collection in ?. Each catalog number in the book corresponds to a fossil in the collection.

The UCLA Catalog Record books are located in the metal cabinet to the right of the western entrance, behind the reprint library. The catalogs are arranged in ascending numerical order. Please keep the books in that order. This workflow needs to be completed in numerical order for the books and then the book pages so that the automatic file naming convention remains accurate. 

:warning: **There should be no food, drinks or chemicals around these historic documents. These are the only copies we maintain.**

   **Select** |  Carefully remove the UCLA Catalog book you plan on scanning and take it to the workstation with the Mac desktop. There is a key in the top of the book's spine which latches the metal bindings together. Place the book on the desk, open the front cover of the book, and pull the key gently upwards to release the metal binding of the book. Remove the front cover and set aside. 
   **Set up** |  Insert the Epson ScanSmart USB into the USB port in the Mac desktop (located behind the screen in the bottom right hand corner). Unplug the apple charging cord if there are no ports available.Turn on the scanner by holding the power button down for 3 seconds. A notification will pop-up on the Mac desktop stating that the scanner is connected to the computer. Click the button with the white slated arrow on the Epson machine and a corresponding light will turn blue. This will slow the scanning speed so that the pages do not get caught in the machine and rip. 
   **Name Files** |  Click on the Epson ScanSmart icon on the bottom banner of the desktop. When the program opens, choose the settings in the top right-hand corner and click "File Name Settings."<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/scanning_filenameconvention.png" alt="" width="600"/>{: .align-center} The red box circled around the file name comes from the catalog record's book range and the purple block corresponds to the beginning page number where you plan to start scanning. You should only need to replace these values when you finish one book and move to another.
 **Scan** |  Remove 10 pages at a time and insert in the document feeder. Click double sided scan in the program.
