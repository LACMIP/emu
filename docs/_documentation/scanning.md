Scanning documentation using the Epson Smart Scanner provides a means to digitizate important and fragile handwritten/type written collections records with optical character recognition. The IP department has used this workflow to digitize taxa cards and historic UCLA catalog record books. 
## Workflow overview for UCLA Catalog Records 
These catalog records contain the specimen and locality documentation for the UCLA invertebrate paleontology collection which was transferred to the LACMIP collection in ?. Each catalog number in the book corresponds to a fossil in the collection.

The UCLA Catalog Record books are located in the metal cabinet to the right of the western entrance, behind the reprint library. The catalogs are arranged in ascending numerical order. Please keep the books in that order. This workflow needs to be completed in numerical order for the books and then the book pages so that the automatic file naming convention remains accurate. 
**There should be no food or drinks or chemicals around these historic documents. These are the only copies we maintain.**

   1 | **Select a UCLA Catalogue Book.** Carefully remove the book you plan on scanning and take it to the workstation with the Mac desktop. There is a key in the top of the book's spine which latches the metal bindings together. Place the book on the desk, open the front cover of the book, and pull the key gently upwards to release the metal binding of the book. Remove the front cover and set aside. 
   2 | **Set up scanner.** Insert the Epson ScanSmart USB into the USB port in the Mac desktop (located behind the screen in the bottom right hand corner). Unplug the apple charging cord if there are no ports available.Turn on the scanner by holding the power button down for 3 seconds. A notification will pop-up on the Mac desktop stating that the scanner is connected to the computer. Click the button with the white slated arrow on the Epson machine and the corresponding light will turn blue. This will slow the scanning speed so that the pages do not get caught in the machine and rip. 
   3 | **Set up file naming conventions.** Click on the Epson ScanSmart icon on the bottom banner of the desktop. When the program opens, choose the settings in the top right-hand corner and click "File Name Settings."
