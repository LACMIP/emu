There are several primary ways to get data out of EMu: copy-paste, user-created reports, and complex reports using [Crystal Reports](https://www.crystalreports.com/).

Please note that for any of the export methods below, there are a couple extra steps if you are accessing EMu via the VPN. To get a file from the remote desktop of the VPN to your local computer, simply drag it into the folder *This PC\G on Guacamole RDP\Download*. A process bar will show up in the lower right of the remote desktop, allowing you to click on the filename to transfer it to your local computer.
