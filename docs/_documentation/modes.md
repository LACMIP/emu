Each module has four possible screen modes—Search, Display, New, and Edit—depending on your task. These modes are briefly described below, and also covered in specific Modules sections.

## Search Mode

Search mode allows you to find records, and is the default mode that opening any module will present. The EMu help website has several good resources:
[Information on basic search](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/How%20to%20search.htm)
[Additional information on advanced searching](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Search%20-%20section.htm)
[Cheatsheet for search terms](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Resources/Downloads/Unicode/EMu_Unicode_Cheatsheet_IE_20170602.pdf)

You can Search for multiple values (OR) by typing each additional value on a new line

You can return to previous searches… [needs content]

BTW, you can set up EMu to always run a sort after your search.  All you have to do is right-click on one of your sort options (like Cat. No.) and select “Sort After Search”.  The selected sort option will then automatically run after every search.  The selected sort option will be in bold text.

## Display Mode

Search results are returned to you in Display Mode. The default order that search results are sorted by is their IRN.

If a column displays a nested table, you may need to expand the line height in order to see additional information, e.g. Cited In in the Taxonomy Module search results. To increase the line height you can either stretch the row height (grab the bottom of the row and pull) or make the row height much larger in List View properties (View>List Settings>Choose List>Select List>Properties>Height)

Much more information is available from EMu at “[Working with Records](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Working%20with%20records.htm)” (use the links in the right hand bar).

## Edit Mode

[needs content]

[Global Replace](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Global%20Replace.htm). Be careful! See [this article](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Wildcards%20in%20a%20Global%20Replace.htm) for advanced global replace using wildcards. **remember to clear any past replaces when you enter a new one**

To use Global Replace to fill blank fields with values, use “Text to find:” = “^$” and be sure to check the regular expression box.

Editing the rank of a taxonomy record, e.g. “Psocodea exists as an order but should now be a superorder.” To do this, please email Bill, who can update the original record. Any children of the record will update automatically.

Deleting records is slow due to EMu’s background validation checks.  Since records can be attached to other records, EMu checks every module to avoid orphaning records.  This takes time.  Two solutions come to mind.  First, you can wait until an appropriate time and delete a group of records at once (maybe during lunch or at the end of the day).  The other solution is to mark records as “Retired” on the security tab instead of deleting them.  A “Retired” record will disappear from all searches and reports, and (if desired), can be deleted overnight. [Only catalog records can be retired?]

In EDITING select one of the three Editing options (insert, append, overwrite) (under “options”)
