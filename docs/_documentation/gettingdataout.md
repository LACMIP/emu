## Reports

Generating simple reports. In order to have your data export as a single file, create a group.

Generating reports can take time. 8 minutes to compile 1000 records in a basic data report, 16 minutes to compile 3000 records in a taxonomic dictionary report.

When I am preparing any NHM data for VertNet or iDigBio I download all of the tables separately.  I then verify data was not corrupted and all records are accounted for.   After that the following things are verified: accidental truncation (either before or after exporting), duplication of data, garbage characters, letters where numbers should be, non-dates where dates should be, obvious misspellings, multiple spellings for the same thing (ie US, USA, and “United States” were all entered), data entered in the wrong columns, missing data (ie a locality for Burbank, CA without the County or Country), and I check that every line in associated tables has data and that data is not duplicated on multiple lines.   When I find problems I send them to Staff for review.
