This page outlines steps to get you started with specimen photography.

# Basic photography
This overview will help you get started with imaging specimens using our Nikon D610 DSLR camera combined with the Nikkor AF Micro-Nikkor 60mm f/2.8D lens.

*Step* | *Workflow task...*
   --- | ---
   Harware | Uncover camera station, turn on: 1) the camera and uncap lens; 2) the lights attached to the copy stand. **Never touch the glass on the lens.**
   Software | On Mac desktop, initiate: 1) *Camera Control Pro 2* with LiveView ("LV") enabled and open the _Pictures_ folder (_Macintosh HD > Users > lacmipvolunteers > Pictures_).
   Position | Orient the specimen using live view (LV) mode). (See [below]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/imaging/#general-tips/) for advice if you are unfamiliar with photographing marine invertebrates.)
   Barcode | Place the specimen label in the field of view such that the barcode is completely visible in the corner of the image. The barcode cannot be visually obscured in any way. At this point, your desktop should look something like [this]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imaging_desktop.png).
   Capture | In the LiveView window, click on the barcode. A box will appear over it. Select "AF and Shoot". 
   QC| The new image will appear in the _Pictures_ folder. Quickly quality control (QC) the image to ensure both the barcode and specimen are in focus.
   Repeat | Repeat the steps above until all necessary views are captured for the specimen (typically 1-2 for bivalves & 2-3 for gastropods).
   Labels | Optional: If labels require a separate image, include the "labels" barcode on the image template. 
   Save | At the end of your imaging session, all files need to be saved to _Google Drive > LACMIP Imaging_ in the appropriate folder directory. They will be automatically renamed and moved overnight. 
   Delete | Once your files have successfully copied to Google Drive (save the last 10 mins of your shift for this task), delete the originals from the _Pictures_ folder before leaving. **Do not delete them until every file has been uploaded.**
   Shut Down | When your imaging shift is complete, replace the lens cap and dust cover on the camera and turn off the lights. Because this is a shared workstation, please keep it tidy!

# Macrophotography

Close-up ("macro" photography of small specimens (fossils that are <1" at their greatest dimension), as well as more detailed images of larger specimens, can be captured using the Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR camera paired with a Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x macro lens and a Cognysis StackShot macro rail.

The [guide to macrophotography](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsrV8OBMxUAjes_QLagHZisrnTrAbwyv/view?usp=sharing) developed for LACMIP's Fossil Insect PEN (2017-2020) outlines how to photograph our smallest specimens.
   
# Saving
## File Names
### Script

### Manual
Avoid manually renaming files whenever possible. However, sometimes file names must be hand keystroked. File names should conform to this format:
-`LACMIP_cat#_Genus_species_etc`

Images containing barcodes can be renamed using the barcode scanner, which acts like a keyboard. Scan the barcode in the image to insert the catalog number into the file name. However, the file name should still be manually altered to conform to the preferred format.

## Google Drive
All images are currently saved to Google Drive: _Shared Drives > LACMIP Imaging_ in one of the following [folders]{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imaging_sharing.png):
- IMLS Type Specimens
- Post-EPICC Originals
- WIS Originals
- Registrar Images

 - Researchers with whom you share the folders should be added as "Contributors" (Add and edit permission, but not permission to delete or move files). 

Share these with Bill Mertz for ingestion into EMu.

# General tips
- If the box contains a pink camera tag, remove it after imaging.
- Typically 1-2 views are captured for bivalves (interior and exterior) & 2-3 views for gastropods (=apertural and abapterural, (plus umbilical views for Trochoidea & Patellogastropoda). Refer to the LACMIP [image gallery](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/gallery?dataset_key=f0a7ca6e-8da6-4629-97bd-0368705a4d6b) on GBIF for examples. The [Digital Atlas of Ancient Life](https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/mollusca/) also has good examples, as well as good introductory anatomical explanations.
- In a given tray, image specimens of similar sizes in sequence. This will cut down on the time needed to adjust the camera height on the copy stand, depending on you workflow.
- Barcodes must be in focus for renaming to work.
