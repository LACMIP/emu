This page outlines steps to get you started with specimen photography.

# Basic photography
This overview will help you get started with imaging specimens using our Nikon D610 DSLR camera combined with the Nikkor AF Micro-Nikkor 60mm f/2.8D lens.

*Step* | *Workflow task...*
   --- | ---
   Initiate | Uncover camera station, turn on camera, uncap lens. **Never touch the glass on the lens.** Turn on the lights attached to the copy stand.
   Software | On Mac desktop, initiate: 1) the software *Camera Control Pro 2* with LiveView ("LV") enabled and the "My Pictures alias" (links to Macintosh HD > Users > lacmipvolunteers > Pictures). Your desktop should look something like [this]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imaging_desktop.png).
   Position | Orient the specimen using live view (LV) mode).
   Barcode | Place the specimen label in the field of view such that the barcode is completely visible in the corner of the image. The barcode must not be visually obscured in any way.
   Capture | Using the mouse, click on the specimen (a box will appear over the fossil) and select "AF and Shoot". 
   QC| The new image will appear in the _Pictures_ folder. Quickly q
   Repeat | Repeat the steps above until [all necessary views](({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/imaging/#general-tips/) are captured for the specimen (typically 1-2 for bivalves & 2-3 for gastropods).
   Labels | Optional: If labels require imaging, include the "labels" barcode on the image template. 
   Save | At the end of your imaging session, all files need to be saved to _Google Drive > LACMIP Imaging_ in the appropriate folder directory. They will be automatically renamed and moved overnight. 
   Delete | Once your files have copied over (save the last 10 mins of your shift for this task), delete the files from the _Pictures_ folder (saved to the Mac HD) before you leave. **Do not delete them until all files are uploaded.**

# Advanced macrophotography

Imaging small specimens (typically inlcudes fossils that are <1" at their greatest dimension) is accomplished using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR camera paired with a Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x macro lens and a Cognysis StackShot macro rail.

Review the [guide to macrophotography](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsrV8OBMxUAjes_QLagHZisrnTrAbwyv/view?usp=sharing) developed for LACMIP's Fossil Insect PEN (2017-2020).

# General tips
- If the box contains a pink camera tag, remove it after imaging.
- Typically 1-2 views are captured for bivalves (interior and exterior) & 2-3 views for gastropods (=apertural and abapterural, (plus umbilical views for Trochoidea & Patellogastropoda). Refer to the LACMIP [image gallery](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/gallery?dataset_key=f0a7ca6e-8da6-4629-97bd-0368705a4d6b) on GBIF for examples. The [Digital Atlas of Ancient Life](https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/mollusca/) also has good examples, as well as good introductory anatomical explanations.
- In a given tray, image specimens of similar sizes in sequence. This will cut down on the time needed to adjust the camera height on the copy stand, depending on you workflow.
- Barcodes must be in focus for renaming to work.
