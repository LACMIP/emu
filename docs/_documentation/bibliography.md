The Bibliography module contains information about publications (books, articles, maps, theses, etc.) related to records in our Catalogue, Taxonomy, and Sites modules. The bibliography records in EMu are not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to point users in the direction of more information. LACMIP also maintains a Zotero library that is a much more comprehensive bibliography. Please see [Axiell's documentation](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/EMu/Bibliography%20module.htm) for generic information about this module.
