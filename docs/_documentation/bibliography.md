The Bibliography module contains information about publications (books, articles, maps, theses, etc.) related to records in our Catalogue, Taxonomy, and Sites modules. The bibliography records in EMu are not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to point users in the direction of more information. LACMIP also maintains a Zotero library that is a much more comprehensive bibliography. Please see [Axiell's documentation](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/EMu/Bibliography%20module.htm) for generic information about this module.

Please note that we typically do not use semicolons in any of the Bibliography module fields because they are used as a separator in the Bibliography summary line, which gets exported for various reports. For example, record the author as "Saul, L. R., R. L. Squires, and L. Groves" vs. "Saul, L. R.; Squires, R. L.; Groves, L."
