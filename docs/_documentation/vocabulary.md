Field
: Each field has a backend name and a descriptive label. Fields may belong to a group.

Attachment
: An attachment links modules together in EMu. By default only the record to which another record was attached will show an attachment relationship, e.g. if you attach a multimedia record to a catalogue record this will be visible from the catalogue record but not the multimedia record. To change this, navigate to View-->Attachments-->Options and check that “Show Tabs” and “Show Search Tabs” are both checked. Now you can see what catalogue records reference a multimedia record by looking under the Objects tab.
