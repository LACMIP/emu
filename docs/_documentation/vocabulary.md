Attachment
: An attachment links modules together in EMu. By default only the record to which another record was attached will show an attachment relationship, e.g. if you attach a multimedia record to a catalogue record this will be visible from the catalogue record but not the multimedia record. To change this, navigate to *View > Attachments > Options* and check that *Show Tabs* and *Show Search Tabs* are both checked. Now you can see what catalogue records reference a multimedia record by looking under the Objects tab.

Delete
: Deleting a record in EMu means that it will be removed from the database. See also "discard".

Discard
: Discarding a record in EMu means that it will be removed from the current group, e.g. search results. See also "delete".

Field
: A field is where the value for a column lives, e.g. you might see "LouElla Saul" in the field for *Collector Name*. Each EMu field has a backend name and a descriptive label, and may belong to a group.

IRN
: The IRN, or "internal resource number", is a unique numeric identifier for each record in EMu. Typically, an IRN is the best way to reference any specific record, e.g. when you are using a spreadsheet to import data into one module that references another module.

Module
: Modules are the core organizational structure for EMu, with each module representing a table in the database. Modules exist globally but can be modified to suit the varying needs of each collection. Modules not in use are typically hidden by the Museum's database manager. See Axiell's documentation on modules [here](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Modules%20section.htm).

Tab
: Tabs are the core design elements of a module, and are used to group fields into a logical user interface. Tabs not in use are typically hidden by the Museum's database manager; ask if you think there may be a useful tab that is currently hidden to you. See Axiell's documentation on commonly used tabs [here](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Common%20tabs.htm?Highlight=tab).
