Groups are a useful way to save and share recordsets in EMu. If you have a set of search criteria that you frequently use, or a set of specific records that you need to share with another person, Groups will help.

## Create a static group

A static group of records is a set that remains the same.  Once created, re-opening that STATIC group will display the same records every time.  Opening a STATIC group does not run the search again.  It is a static list.

Run a SEARCH
View results
TOOLS -> GROUP -> All Records in Results…
Click NEW to save new group
Give your new group a Title.  Description, purpose, and Status are optional.
Note, the number of Records saved is 22.  The TYPE is STATIC
Click OK

To RETRIEVE the GROUP
TOOLS -> GROUP -> Retrieve Group
Select Group and click RETRIEVE

## Create a dynamic group

A dynamic group of records is a set that may change each time the group is opened.  A STATIC group saves a list of records.  A DYNAMIC group saves the search criteria.  Re-opening a DYNAMIC group will run the saved SEARCH again.  

Run a SEARCH
View results
TOOLS -> GROUP -> Save Search Criteria…
Click NEW to save new group
Give your new group a Title.  Description, purpose, and Status are optional.
Note, the number of Records saved is UNKNOWN.   It is UNKNOWN because you are saving the search, not the records
Click OK


To RETRIEVE the GROUP
TOOLS -> GROUP -> Retrieve Group
Select Group and click RETRIEVE

## Add or subtract records

Adding and Subtracting records from a Group or Replacing records in a Group

Run a new search
TOOLS -> GROUP -> All Records in Results…
Select the existing Group you’d like to add these records to
Click ADD
Notice the number of records will change
You may also REPLACE a Group with the new records

You cannot ADD to a DYNAMIC group

To SUBTRACT records from a group
Retrieve a STATIC group
Select records to DISCARD (click in the numbered column on the left.  The record will highlight in blue)
FILE -> DISCARD -> Selected Records
(DISCARD removes records from view, but does not delete them from the database)
TOOLS -> GROUP -> All Records in Results…
Select the existing Group you’d like to REPLACE with the new set
Click REPLACE

(Replacing an existing group with a modified list of records essentially subtracts records from that group)

## Sharing groups

Finally, you may SHARE groups with others
Select the GROUP to share
Click the PROPERTIES button at the top
Click on the SECURITY tab
Select the individual or department to share the group with
Click ADD (or double-click individual or department)
Click OK
Only the creator of the group may edit it
