The Locations module records information about physical storage locations, which can then be attached to catalogue records to track object movement. Please see [Axiell's documentation](http://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/EMu/Locations%20module.htm) for generic information about this module. Documentation about the [Location tab in the Catalogue module]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/cataloging/) may also be helpful.

LACMIP has only recently begun experimenting with using the Locations module. As use continues, this documentation should be updated to reflect current internal best practices. Our theory for creating locations is as shown in the table here:

field | role
--- | ---
Level 1 | DEPARTMENT, always "Invertebrate Paleontology"
Level 2 | BUILDING
Level 3 | CABINET or physical sub-collection
Level 4 | DRAWER or more anything more specific

Below are some examples of various common locations:
