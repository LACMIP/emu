Multiple grants from the National Science Foundation support current digitization initiatives at LACMIP. "Digitization" itself is a broad term and includes the variety of workflows outlined here. For a more thorough review of digitization workflows, see [Nelson *et al.* 2012](https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.209.3135).

# Pre-digitization

## Pre-digitization workflow

Pre-digitization is completed by LACMIP staff.

   --- | ---
   1 | <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitizing_worksheetexample2.png" alt="" width="500"/>{: .align-center} **Select specimens.** Using the stratigraphic collections inventory, select a tray from the collection to be digitized and immediately begin a [new digitization worksheet](https://github.com/LACMIP/emu/blob/master/docs/assets/images/digitizing_digitzationworksheet2020.pdf). Every tray to be digitized will receive a worksheet upon removal from the collection; these workheets must remain with the tray until the digitization process is complete.
   2 | **Verify localities.** Before identifying and rehousing any specimens, check that all associated locality information in EMu is complete and accurate. The fields that will most likely require attention are the _Geographic Details_ and _Collectors_. Filling out these fields will ensure labels will be complete upon printing. Refer to the instructions on [entering new geographic data](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/sites/#entering-new-geographic-data) and the [IP Locality (1) tab](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/sites/#ip-locality-1-tab) if _City/Town_ or _Nearest Place_ are blank. If the _Collectors_ _Names_ or _Start Date/End Date_ fields are blank, look for this information on the [Notes tab](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/sites/#notes-tab) in the Sites module, as well as on old locality cards in the tray. Fill in this information using the “Firstinitial Lastname” format. If the collector is truly unknown, fill in this field with “unknown” in EMu. Collecting dates may be left blank if they are unknown.
   3| <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitizing_localitycard.png" alt="" width="500"/>{: .align-center} **Generate new IP Locality Cards.** Once vetted, run the “IP Locality Cards” report in EMu’s Sites module for all localities in the tray. Print the card(s) on archival paper, plasticize and seal them, and then neatly tuck the card(s) under the specimen boxes in the tray.
   4 | **Sort, identify, and rehouse specimens.** Identifications should be made using the most current taxonomic dictionary available for that fauna. Refer to the [identification](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/digitizing/#identification-guidelines) and [rehousing](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/digitizing/#rehousing-guidelines) guidelines below.
   
## Identification guidelines

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitizing_idtagexample.jpg" alt="" width="600"/>{: .align-center}
- Every distinct taxon that can be identified will receive its own specimen [ID tag](https://lacmip.github.io/emu/documentation/cataloging/#id-tag-anatomy). For older (non-Plio-Pleistocene) collections, specimens are commonly lithified together, meaning multiple tags may be necessary per box. Stack the tags in the order that you would like the specimens cataloged (i.e., first tag on top will be cataloged first).
- Take care to record old (“alt”) catalog numbers from UCLA, CIT, etc. (Ask if you’re unsure whether a number is an old catalog or locality number.)
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/catalogue_alternativenumbersexample.jpg" alt="" width="400"/>{: .align-center}
- _Assume you will not be available if the cataloger has questions._ Therefore, clearly indicate what fields additional information should be entered into, e.g. *ID Comments*, if extensive remarks are made on the back of an ID tag.
- If the specimen’s _Original Nature_ is not “body fossil” and/or the _Anatomy_ is not “shell(s)”, write this information in the space above “New ID”.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitizing_flexspace.png" alt="" width="500"/>{: .align-center}
- In addition to ID tags, [blue “TX” tags](https://github.com/LACMIP/emu/blob/master/docs/assets/images/digitizing_txtagstemplate.pdf) should also be completed for all lots destined for the taxonomic collection. Further, if associated lots are to be sent to the taxonomic collection in the same box (e.g., a bivalve with an associated boring), include both catalog numbers on the tag.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitizing_txtags.png" alt="" width="500"/>{: .align-center}

## Rehousing guidelines
- Rehouse all lots destined for the **ST** collection in **short-sided boxes**. Occasionally, exceptions are made for large lots that might easily spill/jump in short-sided boxes.
- Rehouse all lots destined for the **TX** collection in **tall-sided boxes**.
- Avoid needlessly splitting lots to keep specimens from expanding into neighboring trays (and _especially_ drawers) when possible. Consider designating a few additional specimens as "TX" if that will ultimately mitigate tray overflow into another drawer.

When all specimen sorting, identification, and rehousing is complete, arrange all boxes in this order:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/digitizing_trayarrangement.jpg" alt="Example of how to arrange a specimen lots in a tray. Right-click the image above to enlarge it in a separate tab or window." caption="Once you finish identifying the specimens in a tray, arrange the boxes by locality and taxon. " %}
- **Primarily by locality.** Do not intermix lots from different localities within the tray.
- **Secondarily by taxon.** Beginning with lots containing bivalves, arrange the boxes from left to right (and back to front) in this order: _Bivalvia > Gastropoda > Other Mollusca > Other taxa & trace fossils_
- If a box contains multiple lots (e.g., a bivalve and gastropod), arrange the box according to whichever specimen you deem to be most significant.
- Taxa from the same family should be placed together, e.g. keep all Veneridae lots from the same locality together.
- **All TX lots should be placed together**; this helps ensure that these lots will be correctly entered as “ST” or “TX” during cataloging, as do the blue TX tags.
- Lastly, if you decide some specimens should not be cataloged, they should remain separated by locality, but condensed, if possible. Place these boxes at the far right of the tray. For these lots, add an ID tag with the locality number followed by an “X” (e.g. “LACMIP 12345.X”) and write “do not catalog” in the space for New Name.

# Digitization & Curation

## Physical curation

Physical curation is an important component of the overall digitization process, not only because it increases digitization efficiency, but also because it provides the opportunity to improve things such as taxonomic identifications, physical storage conditions, etc.

### Identification and rehousing

In most cases, specimens need to be rehoused into new boxes and vials prior to cataloging because the old housing tends to be non-standard sizes and/or non-archival. In addition, large lots may need to be split up into smaller lots or sorted by specimen size in order to be effectively rehoused. It is essential that any information about each lot (locality, taxonomy, etc.) is carried over into the new housing.

Specimens also frequently need to be identified or re-identified at this stage. Identification and rehousing are typically done by LACMIP staff, although students and volunteers may be asked to assist on occasion.

### Counting

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitization_tagcount.png" alt="" width="300"/>{: .align-right}

All specimens need to be accurately counted prior to being assigned a catalog number. The count is recorded on the corresponding field of the ID tag, as shown in the image to the right. A few tips for counting...
- Every separate and distinct piece of material counts as one specimen. For example, one rock, even if it has multiple shells stuck to it, is one specimen.
- Very small and incomplete fragments, however, should not be counted. Ask if you are unsure when a fragment is too small to count.
- Unsorted fossils and unsorted sediment always has a count of one.
- If a bivalve is articulated (i.e. the valves are attached to each other), both valves are counted as individual specimens **unless** the bivalve is an internal mold (i.e. a fossil with no shell left just a single rock in the shape of the shell). Articulated bivalves are not common in the older parts of the collection.
- The easiest method for counting large lots is to group specimens in piles of 10 and then tally the piles.

### Painting

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitization_stripechecker.jpg" alt="" width="300"/>{: .align-right}

Vials, plastic boxes, and loose specimens need to be painted and numbered (see below) in case they ever get separated from their printed catalog labels. Paint supplies live in a kit in the front work area containing paint cups, brushes, stripe checkers, and razor blades. A few tips for painting...
- Painting should be completed before cataloging to allow time for drying, preferably overnight.
- All **vials** should be painted with a stripe that extends ~0.25" from the bottom of each vial and is 1/8" wide. The "stripe checker" tool, as seen in the image here, can help guide you when you are new to this step.
- Stand vials on their lids (upside-down) to dry.
- All **plastic boxes** should be painted with a stripe that extends ~0.25" from the lower left corner of each box and is 1/8" wide. The "stripe checker" tool, as seen in the image here, can help guide you when you are new to this step.
- **Loose specimens** may or may not need to be painted. Check with LACMIP staff before painting loose specimens, as the placement of the paint stripe is important.
- Steady each specimen or vial against the table to help paint smooth, clean stripes.
- If a specimen has multiple ID tags (indicating multiple lots), you will need to **paint additional stripes to provide space for each catalog number**. Typically one stripe per catalog number is fine, but if you have a specimen with an excessive amount of lots, please ask LACMIP staff for advice. Additional stripes are always painted below one another on vials.
- Never let paint dry on brushes! Keep a water cup and paper towel handy for quick cleaning, and as soon as you have completely finished painting, wash your brush in the sink thoroughly and rinse out your water cup.

### Numbering

Vials, plastic boxes, and loose specimens need to be numbered after being painted, in case they ever get separated from their printed catalog labels. The #1 rule of numbering specimens is that **neatness counts**! Use either a 01 or 005 black Pigma Micron pen to number. Letters and numbers should be written according to the example here (e.g. do not cross 7’s, etc.):

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/digitization_numbering.png" alt="example of how to write LACMIP catalog numbers" caption="" %}

If a lot has more than one lot number, both numbers need to be written. Ideally the specimen has enough space to use multiple paint stripes: one for each complete catalog number. If there is not enough space you may need to write out the locality number only once and separate the lot numbers with a comma. This typically happens when you are numbering directly onto a loose specimen; if this is the case, ask LACMIP staff for advice.

A few tips for numbering...
- Press lightly and use short pen strokes, as though you are painting the number on.
- Steady the specimen or vial against the table with one hand while numbering.
- Avoid touching the ink before it’s dried, unless you make a mistake, in which case you can try to immediately rub off the number and start over.

### Labels

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/digitization_labels.jpg" alt="" width="300"/>{: .align-right}

Once specimens have been cataloged, new labels are printed and must be cut/placed before the specimen tray can return to its permanent storage location. The image to the right depicts an example of a newly-labeled specimen. Labeling involves the following steps...
1. Use the paper cutter to cut labels neatly, leaving a thin border around the black outline. **Never cut more than once sheet of labels at a time**.
1. Separate ST/TX labels and arrange each pile in numerical order by locality number.
1. Find the tray of specimens to which the labels belong. Match each label to its specimen, then either neatly fold on the dotted line and place the label inside the specimen box (for lots housed loose or in small vials) **or** neatly cut on the dotted line and place the label inside the specimen vial (for EPICC lots housed in medium and large vials). Note that...
    - non-EPICC lots may not need to have their label cut and placed inside the vial; please check with LACMIP staff
    - Some boxes will require multiple labels (one per lot).
    - Left-justify labels, with additional labels visible to the right when they are present.
    - When placing the label inside a vial, always remove specimens first, and orient the ST/TX box on the label at the bottom of the vial (away from the cap).
    - Never force specimens back into a vial. They need to have some breathing space. If you are struggling to get all of the specimens back into the vial after putting the label in, ask for help.
    - In the case of TX specimens, whenever possible place all relevant tags and labels inside the vial with the specimens. Only do this if you can do so without damaging the specimens or paper.
    - Older labels should not be removed from their boxes. This includes the handwritten labels, as well as labels on printer paper (c. 2004-2013) and new ID tags.
    - Watch for labels with missing/incorrect information as they will need reprinting! It is especially important to spot check the lot count and taxonomic identification between the handwritten ID tag and the printed label.
