This documentation explains how to catalog specimens that have very little to no provenance data that are destined for use in the **education ("ED")** and outreach collections. Do not catalog specimens with research potential into this collection.

# Introduction

Before cataloging any specimens into the ED collection, verify with the curator or collections manager that this is an appropriate step to take. Specimens with research potential should not be cataloged into the ED collection.

Some specimens

## 1. Load defaults
Begin by creating a new record and loading prepopulated default values. In the new record, navigate to: _Edit > Default Values > Change_ and select "IP ED Collection". Doing so will pre-populate the record so that several critical values are automatically filled out. These values include:

  Tab | _Field_ | Value
  --- | --- | ---
   Invert. Paleo. | _Locality_ | LACMIP 500000
   Invert. Paleo. | _Disposition_ | in collection
   Invert. Paleo. | _Collection_ | ED
   Invert. Paleo. | _Project_ | Outreach
   Invert. Paleo. | _Lot Remarks_ | ED LOC:
   Security | _Publish on Internet_ | No

## 2. Catalog specimen

In addition to the default values outlined above, complete the following:

Tab | _Field_ | Explanation
  --- | --- | ---
   Invert. Paleo. | _Accn. Lot_ | If the accession number is known, it should be attached to this field. If no attachment is available, at minimum, transcribe the number into _Accn. No._
   
Accesssion data must be filled out for catalog records attached to LACMIP loc. 500,000 whenever this information is known. A quick reference for commonly used accession numbers for the ED collection is available below.
