# Advanced macrophotography

Imaging small specimens (typically inlcudes fossils that are <1" at their greatest dimension) is accomplished using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR camera paired with a Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x macro lens and a Cognysis StackShot macro rail.

Review the guide to macrophotography developed for LACMIP's Fossil Insect PEN (2017-2020).
